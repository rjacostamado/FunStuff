Hey babe, it's me parked outside your house 
I know that he's asleep, so listen to me now 
Darlin', I'm tired of living just in your dreams 
I'm getting out 
You know we both sold our souls 
We're just growing old in this sleepy, dead-end town 

Destination anywhere - Name the place, I'll be there 
Pack a bag and we're out of here - let's run 

Baby, we both been running uphill for too long 
We both settled for something, got nothing 
And we both know that it's wrong 
Go on admit it if we lived it 
I'm leaving, get your boots and come on 
I've got my coat and my keys 
I need you next to me then I'm gone, come on 

Destination anywhere - Name the place and I'll be there 
Pack a bag and we're out of here - let's run 
Destination anywhere - Left or right, I don't care 
Baby we'll just disappear like the sun, ooh... 

[Guitar solo]

When these wheels spin, baby they can all eat our dust 
As far as I'm concerned, this whole town lost its nuts 
We won't be here when they put us down 
It's our big chance, I'm calling you now 
They'll never let us go unless we try 
I'm tired of living just to die 
We're getting out of here, destination anywhere 

Destination anywhere - Name the place and I'll be there 
Pack a bag and we're out of here - let's run 
Destination anywhere - Left or right, I don't care 
Maybe we'll just disappear chase the sun 
Come on, come on, come on
