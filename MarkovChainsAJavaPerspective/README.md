# MarkovChainsAJavaPerspective

This repository contains Java source code and examples related to Markov chains, developed as part of the **Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization** offered on **Coursera** by **Duke University**.

## 📚 About

The material in this repository was created to support my learning and understanding of:

- Markov chains and basic stochastic processes
- Object-oriented programming principles in Java
- Simulation of probabilistic systems using Java

This work was completed as part of the final projects and exercises within the Coursera specialization.

## 🛠️ Contents

- Java implementations of discrete-time Markov chains
- Sample simulations and result analysis
- Clear in-line documentation and structured class design

## 🧑‍🎓 License & Use

This code is shared for **educational and reference purposes** only. If you reuse or adapt any portion of the code, please credit this repository appropriately.
